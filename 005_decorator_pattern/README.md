# Decorator Pattern

## What is this?

The decorator pattern is a mean of adding in additional functionality to a method via means of passing it through another function which returns a "decorated" version of the original.

Decorators in Python leverage the pattern of functions returning functions.

## How do I use this?

- Read the code in `main.py`
- Run the code in `main.py` (`python main.py`) 
- Observe output

## Issues

- I do not know how to make it work without the `@name` syntax
