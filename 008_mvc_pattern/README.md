# MVC Pattern

## What is this?

This is a demonstration of the MVC pattern in Python. The MVC pattern allows for a very distinct separation of concerns between components by creating a clean separation between the logic that is required to render and accept input, and the logic that is required to validated, manipulate, store, update, delete and retrieve data. MVC stands for Model View Controller.

M - Model - Where the data and business logic live
V - View - Where the representation of data is presented to a client 
C - Controller - A middle man between the View and the Model

View <-DATA-> Controller <-DATA-> Model

## How do I use this?

- Read `main.py`
- Run `main.py`
- Observe output
