## What is this?

The facade design pattern is all about creating simple interfaces to complex systems. The main idea is that in order to leverage the power of something without knowing everything about it a client can be provided with a simple tool set. For instance in order to use a computer you don't need to know how everything works; it is sufficient to be able to push the on button and use a keyboard and mouse to select what the computer should do for you.

- Run the code in `main.py` (`python main.py`) 
- Observe output
