# State Pattern

## What is this?

This is a demonstration of the State Pattern in action. The State Pattern builds on the computer science concept of the finite state machine a concept whose central tenants is the mutation of the state of an object to a known set of "from" states to a known set "to" states. A very basic example is a light switch. It can got from the "off" state to the "on" state and from the "on" state to the "off" state.

## How do I use this?

- Read it - `cat main.py`
- Run it - `python main.py`
- Observe the output

## Notes

- This example uses the `state_machine` which must be downloaded via `pip`
    - `pip install state_machine`
