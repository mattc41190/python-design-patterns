# Interpreter Pattern

## What is this?

This is a small demonstration of the interpreter design pattern. The intent of this design pattern is still a bit fuzzy to me to be honest, but the main idea for the demonstration is that we can create a very high level DSL out of Python. To do this we create a "grammar" and implement functionality for that grammar.

## How do I use this?

- Read the code
- Run the code `python main.py`
- Observe the output
