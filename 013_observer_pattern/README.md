# Observer Pattern 

## What is this?

This is a small demonstration of the Observer Design Pattern. The Observer Pattern is useful in situation where an unknown and possibly dynamic group of listeners want to know about a particular event or set of events. We set up a single "Publisher" ("Observable") and may have as many "Subscribers" ("Observers") as we want.

## How do I use this?

- Read the code `cat main.py`
- Run the code `python main.py`
- Observe the output
