# Builder Pattern

## What is it?

A builder can assist you in constructing large complex objects and moreover can assists you building items with similar components whose implementations differ.

In the case of this example there are essentially three roles. Using the pizza example from the python example included here:

- The client (the person programming the thing)
    - Akin to a patron of a pizza restaurant
- The director (the code responsible for communicating between the client and the builder)
    - Akin to a waiter 
- The builder (the code responsible for assembling a complex object)
    - Akin to a chef 

## How do I use this?

- Make sure a virtual env running 3.7.* is running
- Read the code ~120 lines (very simple)
- Run `python main.py`
- Follow prompts 
- Observe output
